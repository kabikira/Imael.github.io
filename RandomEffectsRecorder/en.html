<h1>RandomEffectsRecorder</h1>
<p>This App is a recorder with random effects.<br>
It gives a different stimulus to your composition and sampling.<br>
Distortion, delay, and reverb effect presets and parameters are all set randomly.<br>
The order in which effects are applied, such as delay -> distortion -> reverb, is also random.</p>
<p>Recorded files are stored on the iPhone or iPad.<br>
You can easily play, stop, and delete from the app screen.<br>
It is recommended to record for a long time because reverberation sounds are often included.<br>
A folder named R.E.Recorder will be created in the iPhone folder and the audio file will be saved there.<br></p>
